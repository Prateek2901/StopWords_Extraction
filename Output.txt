Android provides third-party applications extensive API includes access phone hardware, settings, user data. Access privacy- security-relevant parts API controlled install-time application permis- sion system. We study Android applications determine whether Android developers follow least privilege permission requests. We built Stowaway, tool detects overprivilege compiled Android applications. Stowaway determines set API calls application uses maps API calls permissions. We used auto- mated testing tools Android API order build permission map necessary detecting overpriv- ilege. We apply Stowaway set 940 applications find one-third overprivileged. We investigate causes overprivilege find evidence developers trying follow least privilege sometimes fail due insufficient API documentation.Smartphones become essential part human life usage grown exponentially past years. The growth smartphone usage directly linked ability support third-party applications offered online application markets. Due worldwide adoption widespread popularity, mobile malware attacks also growing alarming rate (http://bit.ly/sbtujI). Malware authors make use third-party applications inject malicious content smartphones thus compromise phone " security. In response, mobile security research become critical focused protecting smartphones malware attacks security threats. In paper, present survey techniques used detect mobile malware wild discuss limitations current techniques provide tips protect smartphones potential security threats.
